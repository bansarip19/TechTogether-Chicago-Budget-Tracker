        If you save throughout the month, you could have enough money for a something special! Imagine going to Chicago's famous music festival, Lollapalooza. Or maybe you are a sports fan and having great seats at a Cubs or Bears game would be a dream come true. Or how about buying a Kayak and exploring the Chicago river? An amazing goal motivates us to save!
