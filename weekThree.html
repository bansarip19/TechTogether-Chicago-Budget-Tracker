        <h3>But did you know that many banks will give you <span>FREE MONEY</span> just for keeping your money in a savings account? Yes, you read that right, banks will give you an Annual Yield Percentage (APY) that is calculated by the total amount of money you have in your savings account. This is an interest rate that the bank <span>PAYS YOU</span> in return for you essentially lending them your money. This means that the more money you have in your savings account, the more money the bank will give you, all for free and without having to do anything extra! Isn't that just awesome?</h3>

        <p>
            Not all banks will give you the same Annual Yield Percentage (APY) for your savings account, so it is a good idea to research and compare the savings account APY rate for different banks in your area. The higher the APY rate, the more <span>MONEY</span> you end up getting each month!
